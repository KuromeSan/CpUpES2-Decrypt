# CpUpES2-Decrypt
A tool to decrypt "UpdaterES2.CpUp" from PSVita DevKit Update Files

Made possible by Zecoaxco and VVildCard777 for dumping the CP EMMC. 
And Mathieulh for helping me with stuffs, and answering all my stupid questions.

Output is a tar.gz file, where fsimage1.trf is encrypted, and fsimage0.trf is signed (but unencrypted) AXFS file-system image.

fsimage decryption : <to-be-developed>
