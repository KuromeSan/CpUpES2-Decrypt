# CpUpES2-Decrypt
A tool to decrypt "UpdaterES2.CpUp" from PSVita DevKit Update Files
(im not the first to do this, but afaik im the first to do it *publicly*)

Made possible by Zecoaxco and VVildCard777 for dumping the CP EMMC. 
And Mathieulh for helping me with stuffs, and answering all my stupid questions.

Output is a tar.gz file, where fsimage1.trf is encrypted, and fsimage0.trf is signed (but unencrypted) AXFS file-system image.

fsimage decryption : <to-be-developed>
